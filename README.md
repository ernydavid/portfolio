My web portfolio made in NextJS, using [Leerob's portfolio](https://leerob.com/) as inspiration.

You will see the preview of portfolio [here](https://ernysalcedo.com)

## Getting Started

First, clone [repository](https://github.com/ernydavid/portfolio.git)

Then:

```bash
cd portfolio
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# and
npm run dev
# or
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the content of all data page by modifying `data/portfolio-data.ts`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file and save the content. You can add more items on arrays or add new objets, feel free to modify anything.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.

Good Luck and give me stars if you like it!
